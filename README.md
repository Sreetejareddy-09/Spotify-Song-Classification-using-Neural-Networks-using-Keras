# Spotify-Song-Classification-using-Neural-Networks-using-Keras
This project focuses on building and training a neural network using Keras to classify songs from the Spotify dataset. The goal is to predict whether a song will make it to the Billboard Hot-100 list based on 15 audio features. The dataset contains 6,398 tracks, labeled as 1 (made it to Hot-100) or 0 (did not make it).
